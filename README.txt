Note:
The manuscript indicates that 10,000 bootstrap replicates were made which is reflected in the output figures and datasets. However, for the purpose of reproducibility, the R script indicates that 100 replicates are to be made so as not to burden users with excessive replicates until they are ready to change the number of replicates themselves. At this point, within the same cluster in the R script, the saving step can be uncommented to save the intermediate datasets to reflect the desired number of replicates by the experienced user.
